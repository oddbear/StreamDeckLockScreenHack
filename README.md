# StreamDeckLockScreenHack
Turns off the StreamDeck when computer is locked.<br />
At least, most of the times.

Unzip to `%appdata%` folder, and create a scheduled task that triggers `At startup`, check `Hidden` and `Run whether user is logged in or not`.

Dependencies:
 - [StreamDeckSharp](https://github.com/OpenMacroBoard/StreamDeckSharp) (they did 99.99% of the work)
